        <h1>Alaskan Energy Infrastructure (AEI) : Advancing Community Driven Renewable Energy</h1>
        <div class="project-title">Project Summary</div>
        <p>
          The Alaskan Energy Infrastructure (AEI) project is a statewide initiative—spanning urban, remote, and energy-challenged communities—designed to accelerate the transition to long-lasting, renewable energy infrastructure. In a state covering over 375 million acres and home to approximately 740,000 residents across more than 200 diverse communities, achieving energy stability in Alaska presents unique challenges. Many communities remain disconnected from centralized energy grids and face severe climate adaptation pressures. As such, the development of stable energy systems must be adaptable, collaborative, and grounded in data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as Alaska once achieved long-term energy security through oil and gas, it now faces the opportunity—and responsibility—to build new energy infrastructure that ensures the same level of resilience for future generations.

            <h3>Professional Background</h3>
            <p>At Caltech, I pursued physics, studying energy and materials science. I participated in research projects including hydrogen storage for fuel-cell vehicles with Dr. Brent Fultz. At the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), I focused on improving perovskite solar cells for commercial applications. For my senior thesis, I worked with Dr. Harry Atwater, researching tin oxide electron transport layers supporting innovative energy solutions. I then served Alaskans as a Beckman Science Policy Fellow for Senator Dan Sullivan (R, AK). I provided legislative input and delivered updates to the Senator on environmental issues. Despite working for a pro-oil Senator, I gained valuable experience and served Alaska by advocating for data driven science policy. I discovered that sustainable living policies need local data and the support of advocacy groups in order to navigate the public policy arena. After graduating, I joined the Severn River Association (SRA) and Chesapeake Bay Foundation (CBF) to support conservation through water quality monitoring. I enjoyed collecting data, but wanted to influence my community and advocate for systemic change. My experience with the SRA reinforced my desire to take an active role in environmental protection. I later collaborated with the Chesapeake Bay Foundation (CBF). I advocated for long-term sustainable regulations on oyster harvesting, networked with other advocacy groups, and worked alongside other Science Policy Advisors.</p>

            <h3>Personal Story</h3>
            <p>Born and raised amidst Alaska’s vast wilderness, I have always drawn inspiration from the natural beauty that defines the state. I grew up in the Matanuska-Susitna Valley, guided by passionate teachers and scout leaders who instilled in me a deep appreciation for community, leadership, and the environment. My education was shaped not only in the classroom but through meaningful, real-world experiences. As a student, I served in the Alaska Association of Student Governments as Parliamentarian, President, and conference host—roles through which I developed leadership skills and met my husband, Adam. I also served as a student representative on the local school board alongside now-Governor Mike Dunleavy, where I advocated for increased investment in public education to support future generations. My passion for science grew through participation in the Science Olympiad, the National Ocean Sciences Bowl, and other academic competitions that took me to national and international arenas. One of my proudest accomplishments was launching the “High School of the Future” program, a national competition in which student teams designed innovative curricula, school architecture, and sustainability models. During college, I backpacked across Europe, visiting 13 countries and gaining a deeper appreciation for humanity’s shared history. Since then, I have traveled to all 50 U.S. states, journeyed the Cassiar Highway, transported specialty goods, and participated in historic rallies. As an avid backpacker and hiker, I’ve completed sections of the Appalachian Trail in Shenandoah National Park, explored Black Sands Beach in California, and traversed Crow Pass in Alaska’s Chugach Mountains, among other adventures. Throughout my travels, I’ve remained committed to building community—offering support and connection to peers across continents—while maintaining deep ties to Alaska. I continued to return home several times a year to fish with my grandfather in the rivers of the Kenai Peninsula and with my in-laws in Ketchikan on the Tongass Narrows, where I fell in love with Southeast Alaska.The more time I spent in Ketchikan and Juneau, the more I came to understand that these communities are my lifelong home. After Adam completed 11 years of military service, we returned to Alaska together. I have since transitioned from environmental advocacy work in the Lower 48 to serving Alaskans directly—grounded by my roots, my experiences, and my enduring commitment to this land and its people.</p>

            <h3>What I Do For AEI</h3>
            <p>Generating a Sustainability Assessment (SA) for a community will help identify key areas for improvement. In collaboration with residents, I will organize town halls to provide for public comments and increase visibility of the AEI initiative. I will design surveys and focus groups to assess the sustainability of each sector within the community. To address unique challenges, I will incorporate traditional knowledge and local perspectives.
The project will culminate in the publication of a report aimed at environmental advocacy groups and legislators. I will leverage the AERN and grassroots organizations to support policy recommendations outlined in the Alaskan Energy Infrastructure Report 2025 (AEIR).</p>
