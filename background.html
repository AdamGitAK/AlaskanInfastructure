        <div class="whyAEI-title">Why Alaskan Energy Infrastructure (AEI)?</div>
        <p>
          Alaska’s energy system is still dominated by oil and gas, with petroleum historically supplying most electricity. 
          Since 2010, renewable generation has expanded, but the petroleum industry continues to shape state policy, federal influence, and voter expectations. 
          The Alaska Energy Infrastructure (AEI) project addresses this challenge by advancing common-sense renewable energy solutions that lower costs, 
          create jobs, and build long-term resilience.
        </p>
        <p>
          AEI emphasizes that investing in renewables will reduce household energy expenses, strengthen local job markets, and protect key industries such as 
          fishing and tourism from the impacts of climate change. These gains extend beyond energy: lower costs improve quality of life while stabilizing revenue 
          streams for education, healthcare, and housing. AEI will evaluate sustainable living practices and provide data driven insights to address systemic environmental challenges.
        </p>
        <p> By grounding proposals in data and tailoring projects to the needs of Alaska’s diverse regions, AEI presents renewable energy as the practical path
          to energy independence and economic prosperity. Shifting from dependence on out-of-state petroleum profits to resilient, locally driven infrastructure ensures a more sustainable 
          future for Alaskan communities.
        </p>
        <p> Just as Alaska once achieved long-term energy security through oil and gas, it now faces the opportunity—and responsibility—to build new energy infrastructure 
          that ensures the same level of resilience for future generations. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="summary">
        <div class="summary-title">Alaskan Energy Infrastructure (AEI) Summary</div>
        <p>
          The Alaskan Energy Infrastructure (AEI) project is a statewide initiative—spanning urban, remote, and energy-challenged communities—designed to accelerate the transition 
          to long-lasting, renewable energy infrastructure. In a state covering over 375 million acres and home to approximately 740,000 residents across more than 200 diverse communities, 
          achieving energy stability in Alaska presents unique challenges. Many communities remain disconnected from centralized energy grids and face severe climate adaptation pressures. 
          As such, the development of stable energy systems must be adaptable, collaborative, and grounded in data. 
        </p>
        <p> 
          In the face of the current climate crisis, advancing sustainable living — particularly in Alaska — has never been more urgent. 
          The Alaska Energy Infrastructure (AEI) project will investigate sustainable living solutions tailored to each community. 
          Through design and execution of the AEI project, stakeholder feedback will be gathered, to foster cross-community collaboration, 
          and develop evidence-based policy alternatives to drive meaningful change. 
        </p>
        <p>
          To assess the transition to sustainable living, the Alaska Energy Infrastructure (AEI) project will conduct population surveys 
          across all of Alaska’s boroughs and census areas. The surveys are informed by experts, advocates, executive interviews, and 
          research of what is possible in each area. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Simultaneously, Alaska Energy Regeneration Network (AERN) will share findings in real time by fostering a network of engaged individuals 
          and organizations. Beginning this fall AEI will begin to engage online, with community bulletins, and in print media to engage to inform 
          Alaskans and generate support.  
        </p>
        <p> Finally, the Alaska Energy Infrastructure 2025 Report (AEI 2025 Report) and its policy alternatives will be published on the AERN, this webpage, 
          as well as distributed amongst stakeholders by December 2025. The report will help inform the public and environmental advocacy groups about 
          policy alternatives ahead of the 2026 legislative sessions.

            <h3>Professional Background</h3>
            <p>At Caltech, I pursued physics, studying energy and materials science. I participated in research projects including hydrogen storage for fuel-cell vehicles with Dr. Brent Fultz. At the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), I focused on improving perovskite solar cells for commercial applications. For my senior thesis, I worked with Dr. Harry Atwater, researching tin oxide electron transport layers supporting innovative energy solutions. I then served Alaskans as a Beckman Science Policy Fellow for Senator Dan Sullivan (R, AK). I provided legislative input and delivered updates to the Senator on environmental issues. Despite working for a pro-oil Senator, I gained valuable experience and served Alaska by advocating for data driven science policy. I discovered that sustainable living policies need local data and the support of advocacy groups in order to navigate the public policy arena. After graduating, I joined the Severn River Association (SRA) and Chesapeake Bay Foundation (CBF) to support conservation through water quality monitoring. I enjoyed collecting data, but wanted to influence my community and advocate for systemic change. My experience with the SRA reinforced my desire to take an active role in environmental protection. I later collaborated with the Chesapeake Bay Foundation (CBF). I advocated for long-term sustainable regulations on oyster harvesting, networked with other advocacy groups, and worked alongside other Science Policy Advisors.</p>

            <h3>Personal Story</h3>
            <p>Born and raised in Alaska’s Matanuska-Susitna Valley, I developed an early appreciation for community, public service, and the environment. As a student, I served in the Alaska Association of Student Governments and as a student representative on the local school board with now-Governor Mike Dunleavy, where I advocated for education policy. My interest in science and civic engagement grew through academic competitions and hands-on leadership experiences including starting a non-profit, fishing on the Kenai with my grandfather, and later on backpacking across Europe while attending Caltech. After spending the last decade studying and working in the Lower 48, I returned home with my partner following his military service. I now live and work in Southeast Alaska, bringing a background in environmental advocacy and public engagement to support communities across the state. My work is grounded in a lifelong commitment to Alaska’s people, landscapes, and future.</p>

          <div>
            <h3>What I Do For AEI</h3>
            <p>Generating a Sustainability Assessment (SA) for a community will help identify key areas for improvement. In collaboration with residents, I will organize town halls to provide for public comments and increase visibility of the AEI initiative. I will design surveys and focus groups to assess the sustainability of each sector within the community. To address unique challenges, I will incorporate traditional knowledge and local perspectives.
The project will culminate in the publication of a report aimed at environmental advocacy groups and legislators. I will leverage the AERN and grassroots organizations to support policy recommendations outlined in the Alaskan Energy Infrastructure Report 2025 (AEIR).</p>
