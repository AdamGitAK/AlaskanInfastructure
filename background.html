        <div class="whyAEI-title">Why Alaskan Energy Infrastructure (AEI)?</div>
        <p>
          Alaska’s energy system is still dominated by oil and gas, with petroleum historically supplying most electricity. 
          Since 2010, renewable generation has expanded, but the petroleum industry continues to shape state policy, federal influence, and voter expectations. 
          The Alaska Energy Infrastructure (AEI) project addresses this challenge by advancing common-sense renewable energy solutions that lower costs, 
          create jobs, and build long-term resilience.
        </p>
        <p>
          AEI emphasizes that investing in renewables will reduce household energy expenses, strengthen local job markets, and protect key industries such as 
          fishing and tourism from the impacts of climate change. These gains extend beyond energy: lower costs improve quality of life while stabilizing revenue 
          streams for education, healthcare, and housing. AEI will evaluate sustainable living practices and provide data driven insights to address systemic environmental challenges.
        </p>
        <p> By grounding proposals in data and tailoring projects to the needs of Alaska’s diverse regions, AEI presents renewable energy as the practical path
          to energy independence and economic prosperity. Shifting from dependence on out-of-state petroleum profits to resilient, locally driven infrastructure ensures a more sustainable 
          future for Alaskan communities.
        </p>
        <p> Just as Alaska once achieved long-term energy security through oil and gas, it now faces the opportunity—and responsibility—to build new energy infrastructure 
          that ensures the same level of resilience for future generations. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="summary">
        <div class="summary-title">Alaskan Energy Infrastructure (AEI) Summary</div>
        <p>
          The Alaskan Energy Infrastructure (AEI) project is a statewide initiative—spanning urban, remote, and energy-challenged communities—designed to accelerate the transition 
          to long-lasting, renewable energy infrastructure. In a state covering over 375 million acres and home to approximately 740,000 residents across more than 200 diverse communities, 
          achieving energy stability in Alaska presents unique challenges. Many communities remain disconnected from centralized energy grids and face severe climate adaptation pressures. 
          As such, the development of stable energy systems must be adaptable, collaborative, and grounded in data. 
        </p>
        <p> 
          In the face of the current climate crisis, advancing sustainable living — particularly in Alaska — has never been more urgent. 
          The Alaska Energy Infrastructure (AEI) project will investigate sustainable living solutions tailored to each community. 
          Through design and execution of the AEI project, stakeholder feedback will be gathered, to foster cross-community collaboration, 
          and develop evidence-based policy alternatives to drive meaningful change. 
        </p>
        <p>
          To assess the transition to sustainable living, the Alaska Energy Infrastructure (AEI) project will conduct population surveys 
          across all of Alaska’s boroughs and census areas. The surveys are informed by experts, advocates, executive interviews, and 
          research of what is possible in each area. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Simultaneously, Alaska Energy Regeneration Network (AERN) will share findings in real time by fostering a network of engaged individuals 
          and organizations. Beginning this fall AEI will begin to engage online, with community bulletins, and in print media to engage to inform 
          Alaskans and generate support.  
        </p>
        <p> Finally, the Alaska Energy Infrastructure 2025 Report (AEI 2025 Report) and its policy alternatives will be published on the AERN, this webpage, 
          as well as distributed amongst stakeholders by December 2025. The report will help inform the public and environmental advocacy groups about 
          policy alternatives ahead of the 2026 legislative sessions.

            and census areas will assess current attitudes and levels of support for diversifying the energy grid through renewable 
            infrastructure in each community. Through this comprehensive stakeholder engagement, AEI will identify existing practices, 
            gaps, and critical needs related to heating and lighting across the state. This inclusive approach ensures that policy 
            recommendations are grounded in real-world experiences and reflect the priorities of all Alaskans.

            <h3>Executive Director Ariel Hasse-Zamudio</h3>
            <p> Born and raised in Alaska’s Matanuska-Susitna Valley, I have always dedicated myself to public service, and sustainable living. My passion for science and civic engagement 
              has been bolstered by hands-on leadership experiences including starting a non-profit, spearheading research in the laboratory, and harvest fishing with my family. 
              I graduated with a B.S. in Physics from Caltech and a lot of research experience. It was at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory where a co-worker explained that he had worked on the s
              ame solar cells on the market decades ago. I began to follow the question: why then are there not solar cells on rooftops across America? I discovered the huge role policy plays in 
              implementing scientific innovation and ultimately the improvement of our homes. Through work with various organizations across the country, I have created AEI to participate in the political 
              processes involved in bringing large societal change to Alaska. My work is grounded in a lifelong commitment to Alaska’s people, landscapes, and future. </p>
