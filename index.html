    <p>In the face of the current climate crisis, advancing sustainable living — particularly in Alaska — has never been more urgent. Covering 375 million acres and home to 740 thousand people across more than 200 remote and disconnected communities, Alaska faces unique challenges in transitioning to renewable energy. The Alaska Regeneration (AR) project will investigate sustainable living solutions tailored to each community, allowing me to pursue my passion for science policy. Through design and execution of the AR project, I will gather and analyze data, conduct research, foster cross-community collaboration, and develop evidence-based policy alternatives to drive meaningful change. To assess the transition to sustainable living, the AR project will conduct Sustainability Assessments (SAs) collected through focus groups, surveys, and town halls, all carried out with the permission and guidance of local Indigenous communities. The SAs will evaluate sustainable living practices and provide data-driven insights to address systemic environmental challenges. Simultaneously, Alaska Regeneration will share findings in real time by fostering a network of engaged individuals and organizations through the Alaska Regeneration Network (ARN). The project will also maintain an ongoing social media presence to inform Alaskans and generate public support. Finally, the Alaska Regeneration 2025 Report (AR 2025 Report) and its policy alternatives will be published on the ARN. This network will help inform the public and environmental advocacy groups about policy alternatives ahead of the 2026 legislative sessions. The Alaska Regeneration (AR) project will support both my home state of Alaska and my passion for science policy. The AR project will produce three main deliverables: 1) The Alaska Regeneration Network (ARN), 2) Regular Public Engagement in Science Policy, 3) The Alaska Regeneration 2025 report (AR 2025 Report). The project’s final product, the AR 2025 Report, will provide previously unavailable data to support science policy. This data will be collected through comprehensive sustainability assessments in marginalized communities across Alaska. The report’s findings and recommendations will identify common challenges while addressing the different needs of each community. Public accessibility will be prioritized to strengthen the network and encourage informed, systemic change. Engaging public policy will be actively shared through social media to mobilize the ARN. The solutions outlined in the report will be strategically shared with environmental advocacy groups and policy makers ahead of the 2026 legislative session. The AR 2025 Report will offer actionable solutions across all sectors to support system-wide sustainable living Additionally, the policy recommendations based on the data will promote environmental conservation, including eliminating fossil fuel dependence, advancing housing equality, and supporting education. The AR 2025 Report will provide a framework to inspire and guide environmental conservation efforts nationwide.</p>
