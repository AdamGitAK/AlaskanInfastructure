    <p>Innovation is fundamental to societal progress; however, technological advancements are only as valuable as their effective implementation. As the climate crisis accelerates, the urgency for renewable energy solutions has never been greater. Deploying these solutions requires innovative approaches, particularly in remote regions such as rural Alaska. The Renewable Energy Implementation Solution (REIS) is designed to address these challenges through strategic community collaboration, sustainable resource management, and data-driven implementation. The REIS project, which focuses on the Juneau Borough, specifically targets remote communities without access to the primary hydroelectric grid. The project aims to develop a scalable and replicable framework for micro-renewable energy deployment, ensuring greater accessibility and energy resilience for rural communities. The REIS has five main objectives: Data Collection and Analysis; Explain project and gain permission from communities then collect data with appropriate surveys; Analyze data with a partner from each community; Network for Energy Data in the Juneau Borough; Design renewable energy solutions.</p>
